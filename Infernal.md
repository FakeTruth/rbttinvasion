# Details #

Many people might recognise this bad guy, wether it's from WoW or from his UT2004 brother. Either way, he has never looked better. He tries to kill you by shooting plasma at you, and when you get too close he'll pound the ground that will send you flying! This is one bad guy you don't want to run into at night.
