# Introduction #

Not all RBTTInvasion settings are wave related, there are also global settings

# Translocator #

You can add or remove the translocator from an Invasion game by settings bAllowTranslocator to true or false. Normally TeamDeathmatch doesn't have a translocator, that's why this setting exists in RBTTInvasion. You can find this setting in the UTRBTTInvasion.ini file under RBTTInvasion.RBTTInvasionMutator

```
[RBTTInvasion.RBTTInvasionGameRules]
bAllowTranslocator=True
```
Default value: `bAllowTranslocator=True`
